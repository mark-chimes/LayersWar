For army attacking: 
 - Each army has a leading unit and a bunch of units following
 - The army has a collision box at its front
 - When the army's collision box hits an enemy army's collision box, it goes to attack mode
 - When the army attacks, its front unit attacks and the rest of the units move forward until they reach their place
 - When the units have reached their place, they idle
 - When the front unit is dead, the next unit moves into place
